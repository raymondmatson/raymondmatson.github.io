			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: Some knot invariants come from looking at highly noncommutative associated groups. As these groups can be incredibly difficult to work with, one can instead consider corresponding commutative algebras and representations. However, if you want to still extract knot invariants you need to quantize these algebras and skein theory provides a breathable way to understand these deformations. In 2012, Berest and Samuelson provided a geometric way to understand these invariants and in the process uncovered certain defining modules for a bigger underlying beast, double affine Hecke algebras. I will discuss these module structures and how they act in the context of a newer, more general skein theory recently established by Thang Lê. This new theory, called stated skein theory, provides significant additional algebraic structure to these algebras and modules and will hopefully lead to more insights into a nicer presentation of these DAHAs.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: Fusion products and Demazure modules for type <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> current algebras</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: Since the 1980s, an important area of study has been the category of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras. One way to study these representations is to go from a quantum level to the classical level via a graded limit, which becomes a graded representation of the corresponding current algebra; examples include local Weyl modules and Demazure modules. However, the graded limit of a tensor product of quantum affine algebra modules is not necessarily isomorphic to the tensor product of their graded limits. Instead, the correct notion seems to be that of the fusion product introduced by Feigin and Loktev in 1999, but this product is difficult to work with. Recent work by Biswal, Chari, Shereen, and Wand has found graded characters and generators and relations for the fusion product of a local Weyl module with a level 2 Demazure module for the type <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> current algebra under suitable conditions. In this talk, I will share my work to expand on these results by removing these conditions.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: A key result regarding stability of symmetric group representations states that, given a noetherian ring with unity <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the category FI is "locally noetherian" over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. This means that every FI-submodule of a finitely generated FI-module over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is also finitely generated. We consider the question: what subcategories of FI are locally noetherian? In this talk we show that, for a slightly more general class of categories <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> with a suitably restricted subcategory <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, local noetherianity of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> are equivalent. We apply this result to some subcategories of FI and FIBC that are of interest to the theory of representation stability for finite groups (e.g. the alternating groups <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> and the hyperoctahedral subgroups <span class="math inline">\(D_n\)</span>).</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: From Knot Invariants to Double Affine Hecke Algebras</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: As if quantum deformations weren’t hard enough, we are going to construct an even more deformed object called a double affine Hecke algebra. Double affine Hecke algebras were first introduced by Cherednik to solve conjectures about Macdonald polynomials. If you sprinkle some geometry into the mix, the extra deformations DAHAs carry end up being quite useful in cleaning up some equations, smoothing out certain varieties, and they even pop up in geometric Langlands. As representation theorists, a reasonable question for us to ask is what kind of representations can we put on these DAHAs. Using a commonly studied knot invariant in topology, I will construct a particularly defining module for one specific DAHA.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: Quantum Groups and Skein Theory</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: Quantum groups are a type of noncommutative algebra with a lot of additional structure that are a central focus of study among many representation theorists due to their applications in physics. As interesting as these structures are, their computations can be quite a pain to work with. Skein theory provides a more playful perspective to understand these so-called quantum groups and their representations. If we have enough time, I will attempt to explain the stated skein theory of the simple bigon, which has a surprising amount of algebraic structure.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: Last time I spoke, I discussed character formulae and Demazure modules for finite-dimensional representations of the Lie algebra <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}\)</span>. Today, we will continue that conversation by talking about graded characters of Demazure modules for the current algebra <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}[t]\)</span>. Just as the characters of the finite-dimensional irreducible modules of <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}\)</span> were schur polynomials <span class="math inline">\(s_{\lambda}(z)\)</span>, we will find that the graded characters of level one Demazure modules are specialized Macdonald polynomials <span class="math inline">\(P_{\lambda}(z, q, 0)\)</span>. To study the graded characters of level two Demazure modules, in 2015 Wand introduced the Modules <span class="math inline">\(M(v, \lambda)\)</span> which interpolate between level one and level two Demazure modules. In 2020 in a paper published on the arXiv, Chari et. al. showed that for certain "compatible" pairs <span class="math inline">\((v, \lambda) \in P^+ \times P^+\)</span>, the graded characters of these modules <span class="math inline">\(M(v, \lambda)\)</span> are certain polynomials <span class="math inline">\(G_{v,\lambda}(z, q)\)</span>.

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: Graded Characters for level 2 Demazure modules over <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{so}_{2n}[t]\)</span></li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: In studying the representation theory of any algebra, it is necessary to understand the highest weight modules for that algebra. This has inspired the research surrounding Demazure modules, <span class="math inline">\(D(\ell, \lambda)\)</span> of affine and quantum affine Lie algebras. To study these modules, we move to a maximal parabolic subalgebra, called the current algebra, and examine these modules in this new context. A first step to understanding these modules is to know what their graded characters are. For simply laced Lie algebras, it was shown by Sanderson and Ion that the graded character of <span class="math inline">\(D(1, \lambda)\)</span> is the Macdonald Polynomial <span class="math inline">\(P_{\lambda}(z, q, 0)\)</span>. In 2020, it was shown by Biswal, Chari, Shereen, and Wand that the graded character of <span class="math inline">\(D(2, \lambda)\)</span> are positive linear combinations of Macdonlad polynomials and give explicit formulations. My research is focused on finding similar results for type-<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. This talk is VERY informal, and is meant to walk through my process.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: "Consistent" sequences <span class="math inline">\(\{V_n\}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span>-representations are ubiquitous in geometry and combinatorics. In 2012, Church-Ellenberg-Farb introduced FI-modules to study, among other things, the growth of irreps of <span class="math inline">\(V_n\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases. By doing so, they showed that a sharp constraint on this growth—previously defined by Church-Farb as "uniform representation stability"—is equivalent to a finite generation property of the corresponding FI-module. Building on this framework, Wilson (2014) derived analogous results for representations of the classical Weyl groups. We will discuss this machinery with special attention to types A and B/C, and show some motivating applications.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: The notion of a Demazure module arises naturally from the representation theory of affine and quantum affine Lie algebras. An important family of these are the stable Demazure modules <span class="math inline">\(D(\ell, \lambda)\)</span> which admit an action of the current algebra. To study the structure of these modules, an important question to ask is, "What are their graded characters?" In the simply laced case, it was found through the work of Sanderson and Ion that the specialized Macdonald polynomials <span class="math inline">\(P_{\lambda}(z, q, 0)\)</span> are the characters of the level one Demazure module <span class="math inline">\(D(1, \lambda)\)</span>, and in 2012 Naoi showed that for types BCF to find the graded characters for <span class="math inline">\(D(1, \lambda)\)</span>, it suffices to study the relationship between level one and level two Demazure modules for type A. To tackle this problem, in 2015 Wand introduced the Modules <span class="math inline">\(M(v, \lambda)\)</span> which interpolate between level one and level two Demazure modules.

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: An Introduction to the Quantized Universal Enveloping Algebra</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: Universal enveloping algebras can be seen as the “largest” associative algebra that contains all representations of a Lie algebra. With such an algebra, one can apply a quantum deformation in order to get a quantized enveloping algebra. There are many properties the quantum enveloping algebra has that are inherited from the original as well as properties that don’t transfer. In this talk, we will focus on both the quantum and regular universal enveloping algebras over <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\)</span>. We will note the similarities and differences of such structures which should give rise as to why quantum deformations can be interesting to look into.

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: An Introduction to Supercharacter Theory</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: Classical character theory is a way to condense important information of representations in order to classify groups and algebras up to isomorphism. Although character theory for finite groups is mostly fleshed out, some difficult cases, namely algebra groups, remain. These complicated cases have close relations to nilpotent algebras and quite a bit of Lie theory of these nilpotent algebras. As classical tools don’t seem to work well when computing irreducible characters in these cases, supercharacter theory was introduced and is currently the best we have for classifying these groups. We will discuss how to compute supercharacter theories and if there’s time we will compare classical character tables to supercharacter tables with some nice examples.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: Dubrovnik Skein Theory and Power Sum Elements</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: In this work, we extend some results from the Kauffman bracket and HOMFLYPT skein theories to the Kuffman (Dubrovnik) skein theory. In particular, a definition is given for special “power sum” type elements <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{P}_k\)</span> in the Dubrovnik skein algebra of the annulus <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>. It is justified that these elements are the correct generalization for the Chebyshev polynomials (of the first kind) often used when studying Kauffman bracket skein algebras. Threadings of the <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{P}_k\)</span> are used as generators in a presentation of the Dubrovnik skein algebra of the torus <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}^2\)</span>, where they are shown to satisfy surprisingly simple relations. This description of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}^2\)</span> is in turn used to describe the natural action of this algebra on the skein module of the solid torus. Separate from this, we give strong evidence that the universal character rings for the orthogonal and sympletic Lie groups correspond to the skein algebra <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> in such a way that the Schur functions of type either <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> correspond to annular closures <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{Q}_\lambda\)</span> of minimal idempotents of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras <span class="math inline">\(BMW_n\)</span>.

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: Macdonald Polynomials and Demazure Modules for the Current Algebra <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}[t]\)</span>, Part I</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: The notion of a Demazure module arises naturally from the representation theory of affine and quantum affine Lie algebras. An important family of these are the stable Demazure modules <span class="math inline">\(D(\ell, \lambda)\)</span> which admit an action of the current algebra. To study the structure of these modules, an important question to ask is, “What are their graded characters?” In the simply laced case, it was found through the work of Sanderson and Ion that the specialized Macdonald polynomials <span class="math inline">\(P_{\lambda}(z, q, 0)\)</span> are the characters of the level one Demazure module <span class="math inline">\(D(1, \lambda)\)</span>, and in 2012 Naoi showed that for types BCF to find the graded characters for <span class="math inline">\(D(1, \lambda)\)</span>, it suffices to study the relationship between level one and level two Demazure modules for type <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. To tackle this problem, in 2015 Wand introduced the Modules <span class="math inline">\(M(v, \lambda)\)</span> which interpolate between level one and level two Demazure modules. In 2020 in a paper published on the arXiv, Chari et. al showed for certain pairs <span class="math inline">\((v, \lambda) \in P^+ \times P^+\)</span> that the graded characters of these modules <span class="math inline">\(M(v, \lambda)\)</span> are certain polynomials <span class="math inline">\(G_{v, \lambda}(z, q)\)</span>. In this talk, I will discuss my work to expand this equality to include all pairs of weights <span class="math inline">\((v, \lambda) \in P^+ \times P^+\)</span>.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: The Character Rings of Classical Lie Groups & Symmetric Functions</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: It’s hard to avoid combinatorics when studying representation theory. In this talk, I will explain one reason for why this statement is true. First we will discuss characters of representations of Lie groups, focusing on the cases of <span class="math inline">\(GL_n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(SO_n\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(SP_n\)</span>. Then I will explain what the ring of symmetric functions is and how it can model the behavior of these character rings. Later, I will describe the connections to skein theory.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: Representation Theory for Oriented Matroids</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: I’ll talk about oriented matroid programming, which is a generalization of linear programming, and discuss noncommutative algebras which can be defined for “generic” oriented matroid programs. I will then talk about the representation theory of these algebras is a nice subcase. This is joint work with my advisor, Carl Mautner. This will be a very rough version of my defense, so I’ll love to have as much feedback as possible!</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: Casual Dip into Lie Theory</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: We’ll be taking a pretty comfortable and intuitive look at what a Lie algebra is and how to work with their representations. There will be several examples as we go, primarily coming from Types <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. We’ll wrap with a brief look at the representations that I specifically work with. The aim of this talk is to give those of you in Lie Algebras part <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> some intuition to move forward with. Questions encouraged!

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: In this talk, I will be covering Appendix A2 of H. Barcelo’s and A. Ram’s paper <i>Combinatorial Representation Theory</i>. I will define some concepts relating to partitions and tableaux, culminating in the theorem known as the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: The Symmetric Group, Representation Theory, and Paradoxes in Voting Theory</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: In this talk, I will explain how we can use representation theory of the symmetric group to model voting theory. A voter’s ranking of candidates can be represented using a combinatorial object called a tabloid, and the rankings of a group of voters can be seen as a representation of the group ring <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}S_n\)</span>. We will then turn our attention to positional voting procedures, which assign points to each candidate based on their position in a voter’s choice of tabloid. Lastly, I will present a result of Daugherty et al. that uses representation theory to show that the results of an election can more accurately reflect the choice of voting procedure rather than the views of the voters.</li>

			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Title</b>: Hecke Algebras of Coxeter Systems</li>
			<li style="color: #606060"><b>Abstract</b>: In this talk, I will define Coxeter groups and give a summary of their classification. Using this data, we can define so-called Hecke Algebras. We will mostly focus on the Hecke algebra of type <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span>, and its relationship to representations of the quantum group <span class="math inline">\(U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_n)\)</span>. If time permits, I would also very much like to discuss the Brauer and BMW algebras. I will assume very few prerequisites for this talk, so feel free to sit in even if you are unfamiliar. I will take ideas from Appendix B of the following expository paper by Barcelo & Ram <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9707221.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9707221.pdf</a>, but also some from my personal notes.</li>
