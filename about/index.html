		<p>Hello! I'm Raymond Matson, a recent PhD graduate in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/">University of California, Riverside</a>, where I researched quantum representation theory and low-dimensional topology under the supervision of professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/petersamuelson/home">Peter Samuelson</a>. Specifically, I studied stated skein algebras and how they interact and connect with double affine Hecke algebras. You can find a copy of my dissertation <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9j5281f2">here</a>. Since 2023, I have also had the pleasure of collaborating with <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/hp-labs.html">HP Labs</a> on cutting-edge computer networking research.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Prior to joining UC Riverside, I received my Bachelors of Science in <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/">Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</a> in 2017. My undergraduate research primarily focused on pursuit-evasion on graphs under the guidance of professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/eslivken/">Erik Slivken</a>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In between degrees I worked for <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html">Hewlett-Packard Enterprise</a> under the R&D division of <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/">Aruba Networks</a>. During this time, I had hands-on experience with systems engineering, regularly using resources such as Telnet/Putty, VMWare, ESXi, MySQL, and Ixia while working in RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, Windows, Cisco IOS, H3C, ArubaOS, and ProCurve environments. I also gained lots of programming experience in C, C++, Tcl, Perl, Java, Python, and even some ASM. Fun fact - my unbelievably kind boss from HPE, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Twietmeyer">Tim Twietmeyer</a>, is a famous ultramarathon runner.</p>

			<p>Outside of math, I typically fill up my spare time by playing guitar or composing songs. For any fellow guitar enthusiasts, I own two Ibanez guitars (one is an s series and the other a black knight), an LTD deluxe ec-1000, and an acoustic Gretsch 3700, which I undoubtedly seem to favor.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Once upon a time in high school a couple friends and I started a metal band, in which I played guitar. In order to maintain a minimal amount of embarrassment links will <em>not</em> be provided (although I'm sure if you crawl around the internet long enough you can figure it out). I still enjoy jamming with friends occasionally, although, these days I usually just write and play in my room. If anyone ever wants to talk music (bands, gear, writing, sound engineering, etc.) I'm always available.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Since music is such a big part of my life I'm always interested in attending concerts. The following is a picture I took of the massive choir at the 2018 Latvian Song and Dance Festival (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Song_and_Dance_Festival">Dziesmu un Deju svÄ“tki</a>). This was easily the most impactful musical event I've ever attended. Approximately 16,000 singers performed in this choir, making up about a quarter of the entire stadium that night. You can listen to one of their beautiful performances <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zk1nuBQs7g">here</a>.</p>
