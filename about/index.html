			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				Hello! My name is Raymond Matson and I am a first year PhD student studying Mathematics at <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/">University of California, Riverside</a>. My current research interests include representation theory and algebraic geometry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Prior to joining UC Riverside, I received my Bachelors of Science in <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/">Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</a> in 2017. During my time there I studied pursuit-evasion on graphs under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/eslivken/">Dr. Erik Slivken</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In between degrees I worked for <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html">Hewlett-Packard Enterprise</a> under <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/">Aruba Networks</a>' R&D division. During these couple years I had hands-on experience with systems engineering, regularly using resources such as Telnet/Putty, VMWare, ESXi, MySQL, and Ixia while working in RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, Windows, Cisco IOS, H3C, ArubaOS, and ProCurve environments. I gained lots of experience with many programming languages such as C, C++, Tcl, Perl, Java, Python, and a bit of experience in ASM. Fun fact - my unbelievably nice boss from HPE, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Twietmeyer">Tim Twietmeyer</a>, is a famous ultramarathon runner.
