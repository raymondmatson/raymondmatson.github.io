        <p>My name is Raymond Matson. I am in the process of testing this page out. Here is a random list of mathematical interests:

                <li>- Algebraic Topology (Go homologies!)</li>

            </ul>
            In my free time, I also enjoy playing guitar. Insert stuff here. Test test test test test test test test test test testt est test test test testt est.

        <p>The algebra qualifying exam is just another exam, so naturally it will consist of some finite list of algebra questions for you to respond to. And your responses to these questions will be the basis by which your worth as an algebraist will be judged. So, when studying for this exam, your time is best spent doing exercises and solving problems. Here are a bunch of good exercises and problems to focus on, and resources to help with that.
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="/test/fun/">Fundamental Exercises in Algebra</a> — This is a list of those ubiquitous algebra exercises that pop up on many exams, and are in every algebra textbook. You should know how to answer all of these.
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="/test/chew/">Algebra Problems on Which to Chew</a> — These have got a bit more meat than the fundamental ones.
