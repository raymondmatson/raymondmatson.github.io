        <p>My name is Raymond Matson. I am in the process of testing this page out. Here is a random list of mathematical interests:
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>- Algebraic Topology (Go homologies!)</li>
                <li>- Quantum Representation Theory</li>
                <li>- Quiver Categories</li>
            </ul>
            In my free time, I also enjoy playing guitar. Insert stuff here. Test test test test test test test test test test testt est test test test testt est.

        <p>The algebra qualifying exam is usually quite a time crunch so one of the best ways to study for this exam (and pretty much every written qualifying exam) is by going over a bunch of exercises and solving as many problems as you can find. I've collected a bunch of problems from many different resources for you to use. I'd like to give a huge thank you to <a href="https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~mapierce2/">Mike Pierce</a> for providing me with a majority of these problems! If you have any other suggestions please let me know! A couple of us grad students are also currently working on updating a website, originally made by Alec Martin, where we can have a giant repository of questions for all of UCR's math qualifying exams. If you're interested, feel free to shoot me an email and I will try to keep you updated on this. In the meantime...

        <a href="/test/fun/">Standard Exercises in Algebra</a> — This is a list of those ubiquitous algebra exercises that pop up on many exams and are in most algebra textbooks. You should hopefully know how to solve all of these problems by the time you take your qual!
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="/test/chew/">Algebra Problems on Which to Chew</a> — These have more meat on them than the other exercises.
